# IRCTC tatkal ticket booking
This repository helps to demonstrate the UiPath(RPA) automation capabilities by booking a Tatkal ticket from IRCTC.



## Description
Currently booking a Tatkal ticket through IRCTC is very tedious and time-consuming job. 
There are many challenges faced by a user, from server downtime or timeouts to poor network connectivity. After having logged in, it takes time to fill data, navigate through all the pages and make payment to complete the booking. 

As hundreds of people are booking the tickets, for a user to get confirmed tickets is no easy task as tickets are sold out in minutes. Many are forced to pay double fare for premium tatkal.

Our solution is aimed at addressing this issue. We are a team of certified RPA developers and our passion is to use RPA to improve userâ€™s experience by automating mundane but important tasks. Through our solution, booking Tatkal tickets is as simple as filling a simple template and RPA will take care of the rest! With this, life just got easier for thousands of people every single day trying to book their Tatkal tickets.
