# IRCTC tatkal ticket booking
This repository helps users to book Tatkal tickets using RPA automation.



## Description
Currently booking a Tatkal ticket from IRCTC is very tedious and time-consuming job. 
Sometimes we end up logging multiple times due to slowness of servers, internet speed etc. 
Once we logged in it takes time to fill multiple columns and navigate through pages and then payments to complete the booking. 
As Millions of people try booking the tickets, it’s like gambling with one’s luck to get the confirmed tickets as tickets will be sold out in seconds to sometimes minutes. 
During long vacations, its next to impossible to book a confirmed tickets and people end up in paying double fare for premium tatkal.

Being a team of certified RPA developers, we thought of building an RPA based automated IRCTC Tatkal Booking. Using this solution/Template anyone can book their Tatkal tickets easily and tension free without sitting in front of system and try logging in ‘N’ number of times at dedicated IRCTC Tatkal booking timings.

Once this RPA solution using UI Path is built, we can proudly say it will make Billions of lives easier. It would be one of the best hack in day to day life for this year.
