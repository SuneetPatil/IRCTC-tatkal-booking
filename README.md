Currently booking a Tatkal ticket through IRCTC is a very tedious and time-consuming job. 
There are many challenges faced by a user, from server downtime or timeouts to poor network connectivity. 
Even after having logged in, it takes time to fill data, navigate through all the forms and make payment to complete the booking. 

As Lakhs of people try to book tickets every day, for a user to get confirmed tickets is no easy task as tickets are sold out in minutes. Many are forced to pay an exponential fare for premium tatkal.

We as a team of certified RPA's UiPath developers, aim to improve userâ€™s experience by automating mundane but important tasks. Booking Tatkal tickets is as simple as filling a simple XLS file and our solution will take care of the rest!. 

**With this, life will just get easier for lakhs of people every single day who try to book their Tatkal tickets.**

## How it works:

Below is the work flow of our solution template using UiPath tool.

</p>

* At given time(ie 10am AC tickets and 11am for NON-AC tickets) our solution kick starts the process of IRCTC tatkal booking. It takes the Login details of IRCTC from Windows Credential manager of the local running system(Highly secure) and tries logging in. 
Login with OTP is an alternate way of logging into IRCTC other than regular login with Captcha. We read OTP from Gmail(Gmail login details are extracted from Windows Credential manager of the local running system). Below are the sample imgaes for reference.

</p>

* After successful login, our Solution takes travel details like source, destination, date of travel from XLS and autofills the IRCTC screen and searches from available trains.

* Once all the trains details are fetched, updates tatkal quota and then selects the train mentioned in the XLS and checks for seat availibility.

* Once seat available, fetchs passanger details from XLS and autofills the form as show below.
